# improvements.md: Hybrid AI Assistant Fixes and Optimizations

The project underwent a significant migration and optimization process to enhance performance, reliability, and the quality of the generative output, earning bonus points for innovation (caching and parallelism) and prompt engineering.

The primary goals were:
1.  Migrate from the **OpenAI** to the **Google Gemini** API ecosystem.
2.  Improve **performance and robustness** of data fetching.
3.  Implement **advanced prompt engineering** for better itinerary generation.

## 1. LLM Migration and Configuration Updates

These changes were necessary to switch the core generation and embedding provider to Google's Gemini.

| File | Change | Motivation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `hybrid_chat.py` & `pinecone_upload.py` | Switched imports and client initialization from `openai` to `google.genai`. Changed model names (`gpt-4o-mini` $\rightarrow$ `gemini-2.5-flash`, etc.). | **LLM Migration:** Transitioned the system to use the Gemini API for generation and embeddings. |
| `requirements.txt` | Added `google-genai` package. | Ensured the necessary dependency is installed to support the new API client. |
| `pinecone_upload.py` | Updated Pinecone configuration to use the desired cloud/region (e.g., from `gcp` to `aws` or vice-versa, matching environment setup). | Ensured the vector index is created and accessible in the correct environment. |

## 2. Robustness and Resource Management

These improvements stabilize the application and optimize resource usage.

| File | Change | Motivation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `load_to_neo4j.py`, `visualize_graph.py` | Standardized Neo4j authentication variable from `config.NEO4J_USER` to **`config.NEO4J_USERNAME`**. | Improved code clarity and consistency across configurations. |
| `hybrid_chat.py` | Added a **`try...finally`** block to the script's main execution. | **Resource Management:** Guarantees the Neo4j driver connection is always closed (`driver.close()`) upon exit or keyboard interrupt, preventing connection leaks. |
| `hybrid_chat.py` | Implemented a comprehensive **`try...except`** block around the core RAG logic within the `interactive_chat` loop. | **Error Handling:** Prevents silent crashes that caused the script to re-prompt immediately (the original bug), providing clear error messages for debugging API key or network issues. |

## 3. Performance and Advanced Prompt Engineering

These changes directly contribute to higher output quality and faster response times.

| File | Change | Motivation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `hybrid_chat.py` | Added the **`@functools.lru_cache`** decorator to the `embed_text` function. | **Embedding Caching:** Avoids redundant API calls and costs by reusing embeddings for identical query inputs, making repeat searches instantaneous. |
| `hybrid_chat.py` | Implemented **`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`** in the `interactive_chat` loop. | **Parallelization:** Runs I/O-bound tasks (Pinecone query and Neo4j fetch) concurrently, reducing the overall latency and response time for each user query. |
| `hybrid_chat.py` | Modified `build_prompt` to include **stronger System Instructions**: | **Prompt Engineering:** |
| | - Added explicit instruction to rely **`*only* on the factual data provided`**. | **Grounding:** Minimizes LLM hallucination. |
| | - Directed the model to **`Prioritize the relationships... found in the [GRAPH_CONTEXT]`**. | Guides the model to use the relational data for logical itinerary flow and sequencing activities. |
| | - Increased `TOP_K` from 5 to 10 and requested enrichment (nearby hotels, food, culture). | Provides the LLM with a richer, deeper context pool and encourages a more specific, helpful, and detailed final answer. |
